# TODO(claude): Write a script that accesses pycutest and sif2jax and retrieve the
# (default) dimension of the problems. Then create a figure with histograms for each
# library (plot them on top of each other, with alpha=0.5 or so).
# Use matplotlib for the plots.
# Also write a script that runs this in the container (take inspiration from
# run_tests.sh to see how this is done for this docker-in-docker setup).
