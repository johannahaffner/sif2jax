# TODO: Human review needed
# Complex problem involving matrix permanents and sub-permanents
# Requires detailed analysis of SIF structure and proper sub-permanent calculation
# Current simplified implementation doesn't match pycutest dimensions (120 vs 1133 vars)
# The problem involves:
# - N×N matrix A(i,j) with bounds 0 ≤ A(i,j) ≤ 1
# - Row/column sum variables R(i), C(i)
# - Complex sub-permanent variables P(k) with exponential constraint structure
# - Dimension scaling suggests 2^N sub-permanents for N=10 → ~1024 additional variables
# Attempts made: [simplified matrix + row/col implementation]
# Suspected issues: [incomplete sub-permanent structure, complex SIF interpretation]
# Resources needed: [detailed SIF analysis, permanent calculation expertise]

# DITTERT problem from CUTEst collection - implementation deferred pending human review

# SIF input: N. Gould, March 1992, minor correction by Ph. Shott, Jan 1995
# Classification: OQR2-AN-V-V
