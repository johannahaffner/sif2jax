    The problem is to optimize the net profit of an hypothetical
    wood-pulp plant. The constraints include the usual material
    and energy balances as well as several empirical equations.

    TODO: Human review needed
    This problem requires implementing the complex IFUN85 Fortran function
    that computes nonlinear element functions and their derivatives.
    The implementation would require translating the wood-pulp plant
    mathematical model from Fortran to JAX.
