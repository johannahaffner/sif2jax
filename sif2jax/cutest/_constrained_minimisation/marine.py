# TODO: Human review needed
# Attempts made: [initial analysis only - problem too complex for
#                 immediate implementation]
# Suspected issues: [differential equation collocation methods,
#                    complex SIF structure with multiple parameter sets]
# Resources needed: [domain expert in marine population dynamics,
#                    differential equation solvers,
#                    collocation method expertise]

# This is a marine species population dynamics problem involving:
# - NH=200 subintervals, NE=8 differential equations,
#   NM=21 measurements, NC=2 collocation points
# - Complex differential equation system with collocation approximation
# - Requires specialized domain knowledge and differential equation
#   solver implementation
# Problem should be implemented by someone with expertise in:
# 1. Marine population dynamics modeling
# 2. Differential equation collocation methods
# 3. Complex SIF parameter interpretation
