# TODO: Human review needed
# Attempts made:
#   1. Analysis of SIF file structure
# Suspected issues:
#   - Extremely complex combinatorial problem (permanent of doubly
#     stochastic matrix with zero trace)
#   - Same complexity as MINPERM: involves 2^N sub-permanents (2^10 = 1024 for N=10)
#   - Complex looping and indexing in SIF file
#   - Requires understanding of permanent computation algorithms
#   - Additional trace=0 constraint compared to MINPERM
#   - Classification LQR2-AN-V-V suggests constraints on doubly
#     stochastic property
# Resources needed:
#   - Matrix permanent computation expertise
#   - Analysis of constraint structure for doubly stochastic matrices
#     with zero trace
#   - Potentially prohibitive computational complexity for large N
