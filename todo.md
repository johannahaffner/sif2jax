# Work packages for Claude

This file outlines tasks for Claude Code to complete. 

## Assess families of problems to implement

Problems from the same family often show synergies in implementation - patterns may show up more than once, and this can help when troubleshooting. 

@Claude: From this list, prioritise families of problems to implement according to these criteria: 

- problem complexity: lower is better 
- subset already implemented: yes is better (e.g.: we have working implementations of problems from the POWELL series -> then we can probably leverage what we learned from these to implement the rest)
- problem has extensive dataset: work with no or small problem data
- size of problem family: larger is better 

Give either one or zero points according to the criteria above. Then annotate the families below with their priority score: 

- Four points: priority 1
- Three points: priority 2
- Up to two points: priority 3

## Research strategies to implement data-heavy problems (Johanna)

@Claude: please add problems that are data-heavy to this section. I will research the best ways we can include them.
